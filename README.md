In this version, we don't heat the prior at all but instead choose to by hand set each intermediate state to a posterior having a likelihood equal to a set likelihood with fewer degrees of freedom. Definitely, this doesn't work as well as heating both the likelihood and prior, so let's not do this. (10/17/23)
